            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a purposeful activity directed at achieving certain aims,
                such as transmitting knowledge or fostering skills and character traits. These aims may include the
                development of understanding, rationality, kindness, and honesty. Various researchers emphasize the role
                of critical thinking in order to distinguish education from indoctrination. Some theorists require that
                education results in an improvement of the student while others prefer a value-neutral definition of the
                term. In a slightly different sense, education may also refer, not to the process, but to the product of
                this process: the mental states and dispositions possessed by educated people. Education originated as
                the transmission of cultural heritage from one generation to the next. Today, educational goals
                increasingly encompass new ideas such as the liberation of learners, skills needed for modern society,
                empathy, and complex vocational skills.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education began in prehistory, as adults trained the young in the
                knowledge and skills deemed necessary in their society. In pre-literate societies, this was achieved
                orally and through imitation. Story-telling passed knowledge, values, and skills from one generation to
                the next. As cultures began to extend their knowledge beyond skills that could be readily learned
                through imitation, formal education developed. Schools existed in Egypt at the time of the Middle
                Kingdom.</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">
                The current face of Education in the nation is actually turning out to be a major “silent hindrance” for
                India's track to greater development. While all the attention is on social-political issues, it should
                quickly be turned on to educational reforms. Education has the power to all solve issues(wars,
                unemployment, waste management, corruption etc), in the long run, and a must for a developing country
                like India it cannot be ignored, not to say it is being ignored, India spends a lot of Education(
                somewhat only 2nd after defence), the results aren't actually visible….</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is a very important factor in the economic development of any
                country. India since the early days of independence has always focused on improving the literacy rate in
                our country. Even today the government runs many programs to promote Primary and Higher Education in
                India. Let us study more about them.Education in India means the process of teaching, learning, and
                training of human capital in schools and colleges. This improves and increases knowledge and results in
                skill development hence enhancing the quality of the human capital. Our government has always valued the
                importance of education in India and this is reflected in our economic policies.Indian government
                considers education as a key area where drastic growth and development is required. So various future
                prospects have been considered and policies are drafted. The vision is to ensure that education in India
                is of the highest quality and available to the whole population without discrimination. </p>
